# Containerizing sample Docker Node.js App

This is a simple Node.js web app running in Docker.

Steps:
1. Created project files
   - index.js -- This is the main Node.js app file
   - package.json -- This file defines your app and dependencies
3. Created docker file
4. Created a docker image out of it
5. Ran the container - tested locally on browser(http://localhost:3000/)
6. Finally tagged the image and pushed the tagged image on to dockerhub.
   - Now itâ€™s public at: https://hub.docker.com/r/rohanvasista/docker-node-hello
